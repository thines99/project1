# Source code for truelantern.com blog hub

I am currently creating a new venture that connects families with real-time location information via a mobile app.  I am using this opportunity to create a blog hub area on my website in order to develop content and build brand awareness. This is a template. I spent the most time formatting the index page. The additional Pages are placeholders or created to fulfill the requirements of the assignment.

Requirements: 
    Responsive Size Stack (Index)
    Make a link look like a button - Navigation Bar Sign up (Index)
    Manipulate an image (Index.html, familyfun.html, nurture.html)
    Two bootstrap design components: Navigation Bar, Card, Footer (Index)
    CSS Override (Color, font, size of cards, etc (Index)
    Google fonts (Index)
    Font Awesome (Index Footer with live links)
    Netlify form - (see Sign up Button)
